# Burritoesque

Very much in progress. A simple synthetic test that is supposed to seem like human traffic.

## Deploy

`gcloud app deploy`

## To Do

- Finalize container for GCP
- Allow for other types of traffic (e.g. POSTs)
- Make allowed websites dynamic
- Automate
- Add error reporting and regression testing

## Considerations

- Do I really need to import math? Can I find a way to have waves in traffic?
